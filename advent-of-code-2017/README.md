# [Advent of Code 2017](adventofcode.com/2017)

## What is it?

Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

## Official description

The night before Christmas, one of Santa's Elves calls you in a panic. "The printer's broken! We can't print the *Naughty or Nice List*!" By the time you make it to sub-basement 17, there are only a few minutes until midnight. "We have a big problem," she says; "there must be almost *fifty* bugs in this system, but nothing else can print The List. Stand in this square, quick! There's no time to explain; if you can convince them to pay you in **stars**, you'll be able to--" She pulls a lever and the world goes blurry.

When your eyes can focus again, everything seems a lot more pixelated than before. She must have sent you inside the computer! You check the system clock: `25 milliseconds` until midnight. With that much time, you should be able to collect all **fifty stars** by December 25th.

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day millisecond in the advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants **one star**. Good luck!

## My doing-it

This is my first advent-of-code, and I would like to get better at programming problems.

I wrote all of this in javascript.

You can check my work by:

1) clone this git repo
1) `npm install`
1) `npm test`
